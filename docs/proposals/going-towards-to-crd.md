# Service Catalog going towards to CRDs

 In Service Catalog we want to replace the Aggregated API Server with the CRD solution. This document specifies the concerns and possible solutions for supporting Service Catalog with an Aggregated API Server and the new Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) approach.

## Support both Aggregated API Server and CRDs in the same code-base

Below you will find our concerns about having a single executable binary that supports both the Aggregated API Server and CRDs in the same code-base and changing the behavior by using a feature gate. 

### Business concerns

Adding CRDs via feature flag directly in Helm Chart can be misleading for the client. 
The CRDs itâ€™s not a feature. It is just a new implementation for already existing features. Current [`apiserver.storage.type`: crds/etcd](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog/blob/master/charts/catalog/values.yaml#L61-L62) configuration indicates more extending but not deprecating etcd. We do not want to make customers think that **CRD** or **etcd** is an option as storage. Customers should know that the etcd is deprecated and they should consider switching for CRDs approach as soon as possible.  

Additionally, supporting bugs fixing and adding new features both in Aggregated API Server and CRDs could slow-down the development process.    

Another problem is to have consistent and up-to-date documentation for both solutions. One more time it could be misleading for customers to see that we are going in two directions at once.

### Technical concerns

We need to clearly state that in the Service Catalog, the Aggregated API Server and the CRDs are not only about the underlying storage backend. Around those approaches, we have business logic. Because of that, we will end up with a lot of `if` statements in:
- controller reconcile process 

  |                                   | Aggregated API Server               | CRDs                                                                                      |
  |-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Queries                           | uses FieldSelector                  | use LabelSelector, cause the CRD does not support queries via Fields                      |
  | Removing finalizes                | in `UpdateStatus` method            | in `Update` method                                                                        |
  | ServiceInstance references fields | via custom `reference` sub-resource | does not support the generic sub-resources so, setting those directly via `Update` method |

- `svcat` CLI 

  |         | Aggregated API Server | CRDs              |
  |---------|--------------------|-------------------|
  | Queries | uses FieldSelector | use LabelSelector |
  
- unit tests coverage - we had to also adjust unit tests because we have a slightly different approach, as you can see above. If we want to have one code base then we need to have doubled tests or support both flows in each test.
- validation of incoming Custom Resources (CR)

  | Aggregated API Server                                 | CRDs              |
  |-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
  | `ValidateUpdate` methods and some validation in plugins | Unified and realized only via **ValidatingWebhookConfiguration** |

- defaulting fields of incoming Custom Resources (CR) 

  | Aggregated API Server                                               | CRDs                                                           |
  |---------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
  | `PrepareForUpdate` methods and defaults schemas via `defaulter-gen` | Unified and realised only via **MutatingWebhookConfiguration** |

- defining services in Helm Chart - different RBACs, secrets, deployments, services, etc.

- underlying Kubernetes different version constraint

> **NOTE:** As you can see above the Aggregated API Sever use the validation and mutation in a different way. Sometimes same logic is split across different pkgs. In CRDs we unified that and copied it directly to the webhook domain. If we want to support both the API and CRD concept then we need to invest some time to extract it to some common libs. Then in both places use it with an overhead of adjusting the generic interfaces to a custom one. Additionally, after removing the API Server, we need to migrate them back to the domain as having it extracted will only mess the code and additional abstraction layer can confuse other developers.  
 
> **NOTE:** The described differences are those that we see from the short walk-through. Finally, there may be more differences - especially if we will support adding features both for api-server and CRDs.
 
**From the technical point of view having Aggregated API Server and CRDs in the same code-base it's not a feature gate only in the `service-catalog` binary but in the whole eco-system.** 

## Alternative Solution

Before merging the CRDs solution into the master, create a branch `release-0.1` with the latest release of Service Catalog with Aggregated API Server. 
On the `release-0.1` branch we are still doing the **bug fixing** for this version of Service Catalog but features are not introduced. When some bug will be found then we can fix it and still in an easy way create a release with version `0.1.x` 

In the master branch, we have Service Catalog with the CRD approach. New releases are created with the `0.2.x` version. On the master branch, we are doing both the bug fixing and adding new features.

Above strategy will help us to get new CRD customers fast and will show that the CRD is our new direction.
 
On the other hand, existing Service Catalog customers will see that the old solution is deprecated and will exist till e.g. January 2020,  and all new features will be available with CRDs. Thanks to that they will consider updating their system to the newest version as soon as possible cause the goal is to use the CRD solution as Kubernetes community recommends that.

We can set a reasonable time for supporting bug fixing for the Service Catalog with Aggregated API Server, e.g. Jan 2020

Described solution mitigates concerns from the previous section.
     
## Migration Support

We need to create a migration guide/scripts to convince existing customers to use the new Service Catalog version. The migration needs to be as simple as possible.

The migration will be simpler when we will support only bug-fixing in Aggregated API Server.   

#### Details

The migration logic can be placed in the Service Catalog Helm Chart. 
Customers just need to execute `helm upgrade {release-name} svc-cat/catalog`

Raw scenario:
- **pre-upgrade hook**
  - replace the api-server deployment with the api-server that has a read-only mode
  - backup the Service Catalog resources to the persistent volume
- **upgrade**
  - removes the api-server
  - remove the etcd storage
  - adjust secrets, RBAC etc.
  - upgrade controller manager
  - install webhook server
- **post-upgrade**
  - scale down the controller manager to 0  
  - restore the Service Catalog resources - Spec and Status (status is important cause we do not want to trigger provisioning for already process items)
  - scale up controller manager


## Sum up

We need to be sure that the customer will exactly know in which direction we want to go and why. Supporting only bug fixing for api-server will simplify adding new features and will give time to customers for migration. The migration process will be easier when we will stop developing features in the Aggregated API Server solution. For new contributors, it will be much easier to get familiar with the code base where only one approach is used. 

From our perspective supporting both approaches at the same time with bug fixing and features will just postpone the whole process. Sooner or later, we will have to take all these steps and back to the discussion. The only problem with doing that later can be that it will be harder (technical debt, confused customers, etc.)

What we need:
- set a date e.g. Jan 2020 when api-server will be erased from Service Catalog repository 
- as soon as possible communicate via Service Catalog SIG and all channels about the above decision, provide CRD solution and migration guide already.
